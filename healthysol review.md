  <h2>🧴 What Makes Tallow So Powerful for Skin?</h2>
  <p><strong>Beef tallow</strong> (from grass-fed cattle) may seem unusual, but it’s one of the most nourishing ingredients for the skin. Here's why:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Rich in <strong>vitamins A, D, E, and K</strong></li>
    <li>Closely mimics the skin’s natural oils</li>
    <li>Deeply hydrates without clogging pores</li>
    <li>Helps restore the <strong>skin barrier</strong> and calm inflammation</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🍯 Honey: Nature’s Gentle Healer</h2>
  <p>Raw honey is a time-honored ingredient in natural skincare, and for good reason:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Antibacterial</strong> and <strong>anti-inflammatory</strong></li>
    <li>Soothes redness and irritation</li>
    <li>Locks in moisture (it’s a natural humectant)</li>
    <li>Balances the skin’s microbiome</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Together, <strong>tallow and honey</strong> make an ideal duo for cleansing and healing your skin—naturally.</p>
